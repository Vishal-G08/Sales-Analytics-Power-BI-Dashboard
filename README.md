# Sales Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)📊
A Power BI dashboard showcasing sales, profits, shipments, and product/salesperson performance for a chocolate company known as Awesome Chocolates 🍫🍬.

## Project Overview  
This dashboard, built in Power BI with Excel, provides an intuitive interface to track KPIs—including total sales, profits, shipments, costs, and Product/Salesperson performance—across regions.

## Dashboard Highlights 📈 
Refer to the attached visuals above:
- **Top KPI cards** show Total Sales, Profit, Costs, Shipments, Boxes, and LBS % with monthly growth indicators.
- **Line chart** visualize trends over time (sales, boxes, shipments, costs, profit).
- **Gauge chart** depict shipment volume distribution and overall performance (10% LBS gauge).
- **Tabular view** details sales, profit, profit%, and LBS % for salespeople and products, with icons marking top/under performers.
- **Slicers/buttons** allow real time filtering by category (Bars, Bites, Other),geography (Australia, Canada, India, NZ, UK, USA), and Salesperson/Products.

## Technology Stack 💻  
- Power BI (desktop and service)  
- MS Excel (data cleaning & transformation)  
- DAX (KPI measures)  
- Power Query (ETL/data modeling)

## Project Results 📝  
- Sales KPI cards and visuals revealed strong growth in core product segments, with Peanut Butter Cubes leading in profitability.
- The dashboard highlighted underperforming products like Baker’s Choco Chips, which showed both low profit and high LBS (Low Box Shipments).
- LBS (Low box shipment) performance was above target (>10%), with clear month-on-month tracking to monitor deviations.
- Visual indicators helped quickly spot top-performing sales reps, enabling targeted coaching and recognition.
- Empowers data-driven decision-making by visualizing month-on-month changes and shipment distributions.

## Recommendations 💡 
- Expand top-performing product lines: Scale distribution of high-margin products like Peanut Butter Cubes by allocating more marketing and stock resources.
- Address underperformance: Review pricing, promotions, or packaging changes for low performers like Baker’s Choco Chips to enhance profitability.
- Maintain LBS efficiency: Continue monitoring LBS levels monthly; investigate fluctuations during peak shipment periods. Monitor box volume trends to reduce LBS across regions and enhance supply chain efficiency.
- Coach underperforming salespersons: Use the salesperson performance table to identify salesperson below profit and LBS benchmarks, offer targeted training support.
